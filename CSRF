CSRF  (token is valid till from existing from requst)
	
	- CSRF vulnerability with no defenses
				+ there is no csrf-token to validate, we can create csrf poc to create crafted html to send to intruders

	
	- CSRF where token validation depends on request method
				+ change request method to GET from POST. then create csrf poc to create crafted html to send to intruders
 
				
	- CSRF where token validation depends on token being present
				+ remove the csrf token and see if application accept the requst
				+ modify csrf-token with request
				+ change the request method 
							
	- CSRF where token is not tied to user session
				+ two account is required to test this, from first account capture the request, from another account capture the same requst and copy the token 
						and request the token with first account using following token.
